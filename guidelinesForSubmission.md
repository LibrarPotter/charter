# Guidelines For Submissions to Arceli


## Acceptance Criteria
Astronomy and astrophysics related grey literature, including blogs, tweets, and similar, informal publications.  Content must be scientifically relevant or relevant to the discipline in general (e.g. publication practices, new developments, cultural issues).  To qualify, the item for preservation must be intended to be in its complete, final and  static form.

## Best practices
* If you use Wordpress or similar blog hosting service, install a plugin that allows you to automatically add headers to each of your blog posts (these will become the metadata).
* If you use Tumblr, we suggest that select a theme/skin that displays the keywords in the metadata (such as: )
* Twitter?
* In the submission form accessed using the Arceli Bookmarklette
    * Separate multiple terms with semicolons.
    * Check accuracy of auto-populated fields (such as description and date)
    * The date that appears should be the date the blog was posted
    * List each author who contributed to the blog post using the format: Family name, First name (e.g. Smith, Joanna; Cruz, Juan).
    * Be sure to include each author’s affiliation in the same order that you listed the authors.  If you don’t know an author’s affiliation, use a hyphen as a place holder (e.g. Harvard University, - , Whipple Observatory)
