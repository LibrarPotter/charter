# Guidelines For Submissions to Arceli

## Best practices
*	If you use Wordpress or similar blog hosting service, install a plugin that allows you to automatically add headers to each of your blog posts (these will become the metadata).
* If you use Tumblr, we suggest that select a theme/skin that displays the keywords in the metadata (such as: )
* Twitter?
*	In the submission form accessed using the Arceli Bookmarklette
..* Separate multiple terms with semicolons.
..* Check accuracy of auto-populated fields (such as description and date)
..* The date that appears should be the date the blog was posted
..* List each author who contributed to the blog post using the format: Family name, First name (e.g. Smith, Joanna; Cruz, Juan).
..* Be sure to include each author’s affiliation in the same order that you listed the authors.  If you don’t know an author’s affiliation, use a hyphen as a place holder (e.g. Harvard University, - , Whipple Observatory)
