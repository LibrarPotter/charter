We welcome open contributions to the design of the Archive of Informal Astronomy Communications.

A few guidelines:

* Working Group members can push a change if it is merely a typo or language change that does not change meaning. Please preface the commit message with `EDIT`.
* Working Group members can push a change if it pertains to an area they are uniquely responsible for (e.g., Alberto can directly edit text pertaining to how AIAC interacts with ADS because Alberto speaks for ADS), or is an uncontroversial addition.
* Working Group members can submit any change as a Pull Request to allow discussion before merging.
* The Public and Working Group members can create issues to pose questions without proposing a text change first.

All changes go to `README.md`. Please preserve the text's soft wrapping and use of GitHub Flavored Markdown formatting.
