We welcome open contributions to the design of the Archive of Informal Astronomy Communications.
A few guidelines:

* Working Group members can push a change if it is merely a typo or language change that does not change meaning.
* Working Group members can push a change if it pertains to an area they are uniquely responsible for. (e.g., Alberto can directly edit text pertaining to how AIAC interacts with ADS because Alberto speaks for ADS).
* Working Group members can submit any change as a Pull Request to allow discussion before merging.
* The Public and Working Group members can create issues to pose questions without proposing a text change first.

All changes go to `README.md`. Please preserve the text's soft wrapping. By contributing you consent to a CC-BY license.
